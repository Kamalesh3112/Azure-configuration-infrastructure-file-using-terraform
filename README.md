# What is terraform?
- Terraform is a configuration management tool that is used for to define and present the cloud and software applications in the form of human recognizable configuration code using which you can reuse, alter and share the files.
- It allows teams to work together with a unified set of practices and tools to deliver applications and their supporting infrastructure rapidly and reliably at scale.
- It allows to  define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructureâ€™s lifecycle.
- It can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms. The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly.
- Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.
- A Terraform configuration is a complete document in the Terraform language that tells Terraform how to manage a given collection of infrastructure.



## Configuration language
- Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)

## So let's look into what is meant by Terraform Cloud?
- It is central service that allows to write code and manage all the resources using any data center using terraform which is basically an configuration management tool for Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC).

# Infrastructure code using HCL:
- Find the HCL code files in the above repository dropdown to better understand the infrastructure in the form of code.
- The code compiler used for this project is Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- This project comes under Infrastructure as a Code(IaaC) platform from DevOps.
- Cloud service used are Microsoft Azure and Terraform Cloud.
- The main objective of this project is to represent the configuration that is created in the azure cloud using the configuration management tool called as **Terraform**
