# What is terraform?
-  Terraform is a configuration management tool that is used for to define and present the cloud and software applications in the form of human recognizable configuration code using which you can reuse, alter and share the files.

## Configuration language
- Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)

# Infrastructure code using HCL:
- Find the HCL code files in the above repository dropdown to better understand the infrastructure in the form of code.
- The code compiler used for this project is Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- This project comes under Infrastructure as a Code(IaaC) platform from DevOps.
- Cloud service used are Microsoft Azure and Terraform Cloud.
- The main objective of this project is to represent the configuration that is created in the azure cloud using the configuration management tool called as **Terraform**
