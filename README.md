# Azure-configuration-infrastructure-file-using-terraform
- Project line: This project involves the creation of an Azure infrastructure configuration file using Terraform. Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure. In this project, you have used Terraform to define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.
- By using Terraform, you’ve ensured that the infrastructure setup is repeatable with the same configurations. This eliminates the possibility of human error during the setup process and also makes the setup process faster and more efficient.

Special note:
> This project demonstrates my skills in infrastructure automation, cloud computing, and specifically your expertise in using Terraform with Microsoft Azure. It’s a great example of how infrastructure as code can simplify and streamline the process of managing and provisioning cloud resources. It is really good experience on completing this project. It’s a significant contribution to the field of DevOps and cloud infrastructure management.

# What is terraform?
- Terraform is a configuration management tool that is used for to define and present the cloud and software applications in the form of human recognizable configuration code using which you can reuse, alter and share the files.
- It allows teams to work together with a unified set of practices and tools to deliver applications and their supporting infrastructure rapidly and reliably at scale.
- It allows to  define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative configuration files, and manages your infrastructure’s lifecycle.
- It can manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms. The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly.
- Users define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.
- A Terraform configuration is a complete document in the Terraform language that tells Terraform how to manage a given collection of infrastructure.



## Configuration language
- Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)

### So let's look into what is meant by Terraform Cloud?
- It is central service that allows to write code and manage all the resources using any data center using terraform which is basically an configuration management tool for Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC).

## Infrastructure code using HCL:
- Find the HCL code files in the above repository dropdown to better understand the infrastructure in the form of code.
- The code compiler used for this project is Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
- This project comes under Infrastructure as a Code(IaaC) platform from DevOps.
- Cloud service used are Microsoft Azure and Terraform Cloud.
- The main objective of this project is to represent the configuration that is created in the azure cloud using the configuration management tool called as **Terraform**

## Project note:
- Note that between the terraform format files such as .hcl and .tf files, Either the format files are same.
